In this short guide we will set MongooseIM up and get users chatting right away.
The goal is to get to know MongooseIM, set it up, go through basic operations and validation.

You should have MongooseIM already installed on your machine and the `mongooseimctl` command available.
If you have not installed MIM, please refer to the [installation instructions](./Installation.md).

!!! warning
    This setup is not intended for production.

!!! Note
    This procedure has been tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.x LTS.

## Running MongooseIM

!!! Warning
    MongooseIM will use its default database - Mnesia, which is faster and simpler to set up, but not intended for production purposes when it comes to persistent data.

It is possible to use external databases instead - for more information, see the [database backend configuration](../configuration/database-backends-configuration.md) page.

The following command will start the MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl start
```

When you change the config file and want to restart the MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl restart
```

Use the following command to stop the MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl stop
```
This takes a few seconds.

At any given time, the following command shows the status of a MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl status
```
If the command replies `nodedown` then MongooseIM is not running. Else it will show its status `starting`, `started`, or `stopping`, and its version.

When needed, you can also launch the server in the interactive mode:
```bash
mongooseimctl live
```
This will allow you to better detect and understand the errors in the configuration.
When MongooseIM is properly running, the Erlang shell/console is then shown.
Just type Control-C twice to exit, the server will then be shut down.

For running MongooseIM in a non-interactive way within a supervision system (e.g. systemd), it is recommended to use the foreground mode:
```bash
mongooseimctl foreground
```
Typing Control-C will stop the server.

You can check server loglevel:
```bash
mongooseimctl get_loglevel
```

Run bootstrap scripts for initial configuration:

```
mongooseimctl bootstrap
```

It executes scripts inside the `scripts/` directory with a `bootstrap` prefix in alphabetical order. [More information](../developers-guide/Bootstrap-Scripts.md)

Execute `Hello` from the `scripts/bootstrap01-hello.sh` script that you can find in the release directory `$REPO_DIR/_build/prod/rel/mongooseim`.

## Chat users

### Registering (creating) users

The default XMPP domain served by MongooseIM right after installation is `localhost`.

You can register (create) users with the `mongooseimctl` utility.

This command registers the user `user@localhost` using password `secret`.
```bash
mongooseimctl account registerUser --username user --domain localhost --password secret
```
Examples:
```bash
mongooseimctl account registerUser --username alice --domain localhost --password qwerty
mongooseimctl account registerUser --username bob --domain localhost --password 12345678
mongooseimctl account registerUser --username carol --domain localhost --password abc123
mongooseimctl account registerUser --username dan --domain localhost --password dan
```
!!! Warning
    The password is entered manually in the command line and history is accessible to the command line users.
    This method is not recommended for production use, you may prefer for example [LDAP](../authentication-methods/ldap.md).

You can check that the user account has been created:
```bash
mongooseimctl account checkUser --user alice@localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "account" : {
      "checkUser" : {
        "message" : "User alice@localhost exists",
        "exist" : true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can list all registered users in your host:
```bash
mongooseimctl account listUsers --domain localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "account" : {
      "listUsers" : [
        "alice@localhost",
        "bob@localhost",
        "carol@localhost",
        "dan@localhost"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to delete a user from your host:
```bash
mongooseimctl account removeUser --user dan@localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "account" : {
      "removeUser" : {
        "message" : "User dan@localhost successfully unregistered",
        "jid" : "dan@localhost"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Populate the contact lists (rosters)

As an example, let's add `bob@localhost` as a contact of `alice@localhost`:

```bash
mongooseimctl roster addContact --user alice@localhost --contact bob@localhost --groups '["friends"]' --name Bobby
{
  "data" : {
    "roster" : {
      "addContact" : "Contact added successfully"
    }
  }
}
```

You need to quote `["friends"]` because it is a list of strings - JSON syntax is required for such complex types. The single quotes are there to prevent `bash` from interpreting special characters like `"`.
If you want `alice@locahost` to receive presences from `bob@localhost`, you need to firstly request the subscription:

```bash
mongooseimctl roster subscription --user alice@localhost --contact bob@localhost --action INVITE
{
  "data" : {
    "roster" : {
      "subscription" : "Subscription stanza with type subscribe sent successfully"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, accept the subscription request:

```bash
mongooseimctl roster subscription --user bob@localhost --contact alice@localhost --action ACCEPT
{
  "data" : {
    "roster" : {
      "subscription" : "Subscription stanza with type subscribed sent successfully"
    }
  }
}
```

Verify the contact list:

```bash
mongooseimctl roster listContacts --user alice@localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "roster" : {
      "listContacts" : [
        {
          "subscription" : "TO",
          "name" : "Bobby",
          "jid" : "bob@localhost",
          "groups" : [
            "friends"
          ],
          "ask" : "NONE"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `bob@localhost` has `alice@localhost` in his contacts as well, but he is not subscribed to her presences - the subscriptions are unidirectional.

```bash
mongooseimctl roster listContacts --user bob@localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "roster" : {
      "listContacts" : [
        {
          "subscription" : "FROM",
          "name" : "",
          "jid" : "alice@localhost",
          "groups" : [

          ],
          "ask" : "NONE"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To quickly set up mutual subscriptions between users, you can use `mongooseimctl roster setMutualSubscription`.

## Basic MongooseIM configuration

The main configuration file of MongooseIM is `mongooseim.toml`:
```bash
/etc/mongooseim/mongooseim.toml
```
You can edit this file to tailor MongooseIM to your needs.
Learn more about MongooseIM [configuration files](../configuration/configuration-files.md) in general, or jump right into the [documentations of different `mongooseim.toml` sections](../configuration/general.md). 

For each change, edit the configuration file using the right Linux/Unix user.
Save (and optionally backup, archive, or version) the configuration file and restart the MongooseIM server.

### Logging

Set your own loglevel in the configuration file:
```toml
[general]
  loglevel = "notice"
```

Save and exit your editor, restart MongooseIM and check your loglevel from the command line:
```bash
mongooseimctl get_loglevel
```

Read the `mongooseim.log` file:
```bash
/var/log/mongooseim/mongooseim.log
```

You can use commands such `cat`, `more` or `less`, even `head` or `tail`.
In order to see live logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/mongooseim/mongooseim.log
```
Type `Ctrl+C` to exit.

### MUC (Multi-User Chat) for groupchats

Enable MUC, or Multi-User Chat, for groupchats/channels in the `mongooseim.toml` file:
```toml
[modules.mod_muc]
  host = "muc.@HOST@"
  access = "muc"
  access_create = "muc_create"
```

### Roster versioning

For faster contact list downloads at each client/app (re)connection, edit the configuration file:
```toml
[modules.mod_roster]
  versioning = true
  store_current_id = true
```

### Review configuration

If MongooseIM does not start because the configuration file is broken in some way:
```bash
mongooseimctl live
```

## Using an XMPP/Jabber client/app

The following steps use the registered users on the MongooseIM server, done above.

Users that are registered on your server can now add their accounts in a chat application like Gajim (specifying either the serverâ€™s IP address or domain name), and start chatting!

### Note about session conflicts

If you're going to connect several clients with the same username and domain (for example a phone and a laptop), please make sure they are using different resource names (a kind of device/client identifier).
This should be configurable in the account settings of every XMPP client.

Otherwise, the clients will keep disconnecting each other, because MongooseIM always terminates the older session in case of a conflict.

### Connect Gajim

Gajim is available on Ubuntu, CentOS & Windows.

!!! Warning
    Gajim has an obsolete UX. However, it is still well maintained, and has a console that is extremely useful for debugging and testing/validation purposes at the XMPP protocol level.

1. Launch Gajim. Ignore the window with Plugin updates.
2. Go to Edit -> Accounts.
3. Click **Add** in the left part of the window and select **I already have an account I want to use**, click **Forward**
4. Enter the **user**, **domain** and **password** for the accounts registered previously on the command line
5. Click **Forward** and then **Finish**
6. Ignore the TLS/SSL error/warning and continue
5. Close the Account window.

Add your three created users: `alice`, `bob`, and `carol`.

Check what users are currently connected.
```bash
mongooseimctl session listSessions
{
  "data" : {
    "session" : {
      "listSessions" : [
        {
          "user" : "bob@localhost/BobsComputer,
          "uptime" : 12,
          "priority" : 50,
          "port" : 56267,
          "node" : "mongooseim@localhost",
          "ip" : "127.0.0.1",
          "connection" : "c2s_tls"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The result shows that Bob is currently connected.

### Chat with another person

Use `alice`'s account to send messages directly to `bob` and use `bob`'s account to reply directly to `alice`.

It is possible to send a message from the command line:

```bash
mongooseimctl stanza sendMessage --from alice@localhost --to bob@localhost --body 'Hi Bob!'
```

You need to quote `Hi Bob!`, because it contains a space.
If you do it while Bob is connected, he should receive the message in the XMPP client.

### Group chats

Use `alice`'s account to create a groupchat `channel` on your `muc.localhost` service, and configure it by making it persistent. Invite `bob` and `carol`. From `bob`'s' and `carol`'s accounts, accept the invitation and join the `channel` groupchat. All three users exchange messages.

### Contact lists

Use `carol`'s account to add `alice` and `bob` to her contact list. Use `alice`'s and `bob`'s accounts accept those additions.

Verify on the MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl roster listContacts --user alice@localhost
mongooseimctl roster listContacts --user bob@localhost
```

### Profile (vCard)

Edit `alice`'s profile (vCard) in Gajim: **Modify Account...**, then **Profile**, just set her **Name** to `Alice`.

Verify on the MongooseIM server:
```bash
mongooseimctl vcard getVcard --user alice@localhost
{
  "data" : {
    "vcard" : {
      "getVcard" : {
        (...)
        "telephone" : [
          {
            "tags" : [
              "HOME",
              "VOICE"
            ],
            "number" : "123456789"
          }
        ],
        (...)
        "formattedName" : "Alice",
        (...)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

Now you have the minimum knowledge: you know how to deploy MongooseIM, configure some basic features, check/verify a few useful items, validate it both on the client and server side, and utilize a few good practices.

### Summary: command line

You know `mongooseimctl`, with basic server management commands such as:

* `start`, `restart`, `stop`, `status`, `live`, `foreground`
* `get_loglevel`

Other commands shown above correspond to the [GraphQL Admin API](../../graphql-api/Admin-GraphQL/) operations, and they are grouped into the following categories:

* `account` contains `registerUser`, `checkUser`, `listUsers`, `removeUser`
* `roster` contains `addContact`, `subscription`, `listContacts`, `setMutualSubscription`
* `session` contains `listSessions`
* `stanza` contains `sendMessage`
* `vcard` contains `getVcard`

There are more categories and commands. For a list of categories, use `mongooseimctl` without any arguments. To get a list of commands in a particular category, call `mongooseimctl `*`category`*. You can also get more information about a particular command with `mongooseimctl `*`category command`*` --help`.

### Summary: files

You know basic entries in the files:
`/etc/mongooseim/mongooseim.toml`
`/var/log/mongooseim/mongooseim.log`

### Summary: client/app

In an app, you know how to:

* connect
* chat with another user
* create/join groupchats
* manage contact lists (roster)
* edit profile (vCard)

## Go further

For the next steps, we now encourage you to:

1. Deploy it as a single node, on a publicly accessible server, with a real routable domain name with its certificate
1. Add an RDBMS for persistent data, and LDAP for user directory
1. Enable message history with MAM (Message Archive Management)
1. Enable file exchange with HTTP file upload, with an S3-compatible object storage server
1. Use a mobile app for users to chat
